# Operating-System-Coursework
This repository contains a collection of programs written in C++ that demonstrate various concepts related to operating systems, including process management, inter-process communication, threading, synchronization, and socket programming. These programs are designed to help learners understand and explore fundamental concepts in operating systems and concurrent programming.

**Contents**
Process Management: Programs demonstrating process creation, termination, and communication.
IPC (Inter-Process Communication): Examples of communication between processes using different IPC mechanisms such as pipes, message queues, and shared memory.
Threading: Programs showcasing multi-threading concepts including thread creation, synchronization, and communication.
Synchronization: Examples illustrating synchronization techniques such as mutexes, semaphores, and condition variables.
Socket Programming: Programs demonstrating network communication using sockets, including TCP/IP and UDP protocols.
